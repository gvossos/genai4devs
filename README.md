## Introduction
Welcome to the 'Unlock the Power of Generative AI with crewAI' Project! This project builds upon the CrewAI Stock Analysis project, extending it to a full-fledged Agentic application. Using the CrewAI framework, this service automates the investment analysis process by orchestrating autonomous AI agents to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently.

This repository has been created for demo purposes for the 'GenAI for Developers' Meetup on July 11, 2024, titled "Unlock the Power of Generative AI with CrewAI."

## Inspiration
The inspiration for genai4devs comes from [this video by @Kno2gether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFZHpFuzcBE&t=854s).

## Setup Virtual Environment
# Step 1 - create & activate your VM
>conda create --name genai4devs python=3.10.10 pip

>conda activate genai4dev

# Step 2 - install poetry into VM
>pip install poetry

# Step 3 - install Tensorflow separately via pip
>pip install tensorflow

# Step 4 - clone git repo and move into folder
>git clone https://github.com/gvossos/genai4devs.git

## Setup Configurations
# Step 6 - Rename '.env.examples' to '.env' and setup your KEYS
    OPENAI_API_KEY="KEY"
    NGROK_API_KEY="KEY"
    LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o"

# Step 7 - Setup the workflow
- Iâ€™ve only enabled the Monitoring crew / workflow
        services/service.py > performance_monitoring_flag = True
